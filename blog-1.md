# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
- As TypeScript gives the ability to catch errors early in development and provide type safety, it becomes a strong weapon for JavaScript developers. 
- Among its many powerful features, union and intersection types play a crucial role in TypeScript. 

## Union Types: Extending Flexibility in Type Choices
- A union type allows a variable to contain multiple types of values. It works like OR condition.
- For instance, a function that accepts a number or a string can return a string representation of the input.
- It not only increases flexibility but also simplifies conditional logic.

  ## Intersection Types: Creating Composite Types
  - An intersection type conveys a combination of multiple types. It works like AND condition which means all the conditions have to be true.
  - If you need a type to define an object that is both a person and a teacher, the intersection type can do that.
  - It not only enhances composition but also offers more accurate models.
